{/* I developed a new feature to display related products in Freshis blog posts. I also designed and launched an operational dashboard to manage delivery routes and customer orders in real-time, improving the Freshis delivery process.

Additionally, I redesigned the web mobile app used by pickers to optimize the placement process when they prepare orders and place products in the bag for delivery. I also assisted in testing and developing a new TO-DO extension for Raycast called Hypersonic, connected through Notion with OAuth. */}

Tools used: Node, Express, React + Next.js, Prisma, MySQL.
